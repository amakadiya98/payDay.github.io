                                        <h3 class="answer">If you have ever found yourself in a tricky financial situation, you may only have a few options. You could cut back your expenses, sell possessions or apply for a personal loan. Another option is a payday loan.
                                            A payday loan works much like a personal short-term loan and is used to cover immediate cash needs until your next paycheck. They are ideal for things like car repairs, medical expenses, sudden job loss or just to cover overdrawn accounts.
                                            Having a guaranteed payday loan that approves any credit score is sometimes the best solution for those struggling to get credit elsewhere, who also need the cash fast.</h3>

                                        <h3 class="answer">Getting a payday loan is relatively straightforward and in most cases, you will qualify if you meet the basic requirements. These include being over 18 years old, having a verified source of income, an active checking account and a valid ID. Different lenders may have different criteria so it’s worth checking that before applying.</h3>

                                        <h3 class="answer">Payday loans work in a few simple steps. Generally, you will need to assess your financial situation first to see what your credit score is. With this information, you can find a lender to suit your needs. In some cases, you may need to find a lender who is flexible for those with poor credit.
                                            Once you are happy with a lender, you simply need to submit the information they require, send off the application and wait for a decision. Payday lenders tend to work fast so you should get a response within a day. Our service aims to find you a lender which can provide the funds within 24 hours. This is ideal if you have a sudden expense to cover such as a car repair.</h3>

                                        <h3 class="answer">While there is no 100% guarantee that you will be accepted for a payday loan, most payday lenders will accept those with bad credit. Payday loans are one of the preferred sources of finance for those who are usually turned down from other types of personal loan.</h3>

If you have a good credit score, you will be seen as less of a risk to the lender. In response, the lender will likely offer you a better interest rate or a higher credit limit which will make the loan more affordable.</h3>

                            financial charge for a short-term product.
