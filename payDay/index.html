                        Payday loans are small principal, high-interest loans that are
                        typically due to be repaid within a few weeks. These loans are
                        structured for people who need quick, easy cash to hold them over
                        “until payday”. Payday lenders make it easy to get approved and
                        receive your funds, but they typically charge high interest rates
                        for the convenience and lower credit standards.

                                        When shopping for payday loans, you may see several types of fees that are
                                        applied
                                        on top of the principal loan amount. Expect to pay a small application fee,
                                        especially
                                        if your lender requires a background check. Most lenders also charge origination
                                        fees, which
                                        can be a flat fee or a percentage of the requested loan amount, to cover the
                                        administration
                                        costs of processing and maintaining your loan.

                                        Some lenders also have fees that are avoidable and only apply in certain
                                        situations.
                                        For example, if you miss a loan payment, you may be charged a late fee. Some
                                        lenders
                                        also charge pre-payment fees if you pay your loan off early, while others may
                                        charge
                                        renewal fees if you decide to renew, or take your loan out again, at the end of
                                        a payment
                                        cycle. These fees add to your overall cost of borrowing money and should be
                                        avoided whenever
                                        possible, so make sure you have a plan for repaying the loan and sticking to the
                                        repayment
                                        terms as closely as possible.

                                    Instant payday loans are regulated at the state level, so
                                    lenders must follow the guidelines of the states in which
                                    they operate. For this reason, requirements to get a payday
                                    loan will vary from lender to lender and state to state. In
                                    general, however, lenders require several basic things to
                                    qualify for a loan:
                                </p>

                                            Many payday lenders don’t deal in cash or issue checks for your initial loan
                                            proceeds – they will want to direct deposit your funds into your active
                                            checking account. Many lenders also require your loan repayments to be auto
                                            drafted from the same account.

                                            Income requirements will vary by location, but lenders want to see documents
                                            proof that you can repay the loan when it’s due. While this doesn’t need to

                                            typically run a “soft pull” that doesn’t hurt your credit. Those
                                            with poor credit scores can still qualify as long as there are no
                                            major issues, such as a recent bankruptcy or defaulted payday loan
                                            with another company.

                                            ask your lender for an estimated timetable. Some lenders have

                                            depending on their policies.
